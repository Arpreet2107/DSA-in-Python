# ðŸ§© LeetCode 412. Fizz Buzz
# ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement
# Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
# answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
# answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
# answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
# answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Analogy
# Think of FizzBuzz like announcing a roll call:
# - Every 3rd person says "Fizz"
# - Every 5th person says "Buzz"
# - Every 15th person (both) says "FizzBuzz"
# - Everyone else just says their own number.
